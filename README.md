# Java_Sudoku

A Sudoku solver program in Java is a computer application that takes an unsolved Sudoku puzzle as input and uses algorithms to systematically fill in the missing numbers while ensuring that each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid contains all digits from 1 to 9, providing a fully solved Sudoku grid as the output.

## 3 Rules to follow 

1.Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each row.

2.Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each column.

3.Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each of the 9 3x3 sub-boxes of the grid(each 3*3 matrix).

## NOTE - 

The '.' character indicates empty cells.
